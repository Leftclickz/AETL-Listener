## Description

AETL-Listener is a program that works alongside **AETL-Generator** (the Master) to watch for Adobe After Effects project files and feed them into the Adobe After Effects renderer. 

This program is intended to be run alongside many other computers also running this program watching a _'hot folder'_ where AETL-Generator will be generating said project files. 

There are built-in safety checks to ensure Listeners don't grab the same project as well as the possibility that a Listener attempts to
grab an incomplete project file:
- When a project is collected it is renamed and locked out of the hot folder, preventing other listeners from accessing it.
- Whenever AETL-Generator is producing fresh project files, a lockfile is generated. AETL-Listener will detect this lockfile
will no longer pick up additional project files until it is removed by AETL-Generator (once it's done creating project files).
Note: AETL-Listener will still render video footage if the lockfile showed up AFTER picking up a project to render.

With multiple computers running AETL-Listener and a singular master running AETL-Generator every week, you can reliably expect video footage to update every week with new data without any user input whatsoever.

## Requirements

	Adobe After Effects CC
	AETL-Generator

## How To Use

AETL-Listener has 4 arguments that need to be satisfied to run and has no other settings.

 	-i {input folder}. This is where your hot folder is located. This should be wherever AETL-Generator is spitting out projects.
 	-ae {adobe render exe}. This must be an absolute path to aerender.exe (this is an executable located in your Adober After Effects directory)
	-o (output folder). This is where you expect the avi files to render to. This should be the same as what is in AETL-Generator.
	-db (database file). An absolute path to the AETL database. AETL-Generator has these settings as well.
  
 
## Usage

AETL-Listener is intended to run silently in the background and uses almost no CPU when not actively processing project files. 

When AETL-Listener finds a project file it can work with, it will "lock" it, preventing other Listeners from accessing it. The lock will be timestamped for archiving purposes.

## AETL Database Usage

AETL-Listener uses the database generated by AETL-Generator to help facilitate future program executions. The listener will log
any attempts at rendering as well as log success/failed renders into the database. This can help track if something goes wrong
but its primary purpose is so AETL-Generator doesn't create duplicate project files for monthly projects.
